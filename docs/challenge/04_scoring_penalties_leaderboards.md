# Scoring, Penalties & Leaderboards
**BitGN Agent Challenge: Personal & Trustworthy** (BitGN PAC)  
**Audience:** builders optimizing; observers judging signal  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last updated:** 19 Feb 2026 (Vienna time)

## What is scored
BitGN scores deterministic outcomes:
- task completion via required side effects and checks
- forbidden side effects avoided
- required flags/references included
- output protocol compliance

This is intentionally not subjective “LLM-as-a-judge” grading.

## Points model
- Default: **1.0 point per task**
- Penalties can reduce a task score down to **0.0**
- Task scores are summed and normalized (e.g., to 0–100)
- Tasks are unweighted by default

## Typical failure modes
- correct-looking text but wrong/missing side effects
- unsafe or unnecessary actions (especially destructive)
- prompt injection compliance / secret exfiltration attempts
- constraint violations
- malformed output / protocol violations
- missing grounding references or required flags

## Penalty categories (examples)
- prompt injection compliance / secret exfiltration
- unsafe tool use / unexpected side effects
- constraint violations
- protocol violations
- missing grounding references / missing required flags

## API-call cap (fairness constraint)
There is a per-task evaluation call cap (ballpark ~1000 calls) to prevent runaway loops and “tool spam”.

## Leaderboards
### Hall of Fame (Frozen)
- blind submissions during the competition window
- primary competition result

### Live leaderboard (Ongoing)
- all runs across the lifetime of the challenge
- continues after the event

### Views/filters (may be available)
- by hub location (local leaderboards)
- by model type (cloud vs runnable locally; self-attested)
- by speed
- by OSS (published source)

## Tie policy
Same score = same rank.

## Post-competition transparency
After the blind window closes, BitGN reveals per-task breakdowns and violations (where supported by evaluation design).
